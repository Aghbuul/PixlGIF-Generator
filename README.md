# PixlGIF-Generator

Transform any image into pixel-art sprites, preview animations, and export them as both a sprite sheet and an animated GIF. This web-based tool uses HTML5 Canvas APIs and [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js) under the hood.

## Features
- **Pixelation Controls:** Dynamically adjust pixel size from 1 to 50.
- **Frame Management:** Add frames manually or auto-generate frames over a range (with optional reverse).
- **Animation Preview:** Play/pause animations at custom FPS.
- **Sprite Sheet Generation:** Combine frames horizontally in a single sprite sheet.

## Usage
1. **Open index.html** in your favourite browser or host the folder via GitHub Pages.
2. **Upload an image** using the file input at the top.
3. **Adjust pixelation** with the slider or numeric input.
4. **Add Frames** manually (`Add Frame` button) or via `Auto Add Frames`.
5. **Generate Sprite Sheet** or **Save GIF** once you have frames.
6. **Play Animation** to preview frames in real time.
7. **Reset All** to clear all frames and revert settings.
